# Desktop Live Weather Notifier

## Overview

This Desktop Live Weather Notifier is a Python application that provides live weather updates. It fetches current weather data from the WeatherAPI and displays notifications on the desktop using the win10toast library. You can customize the data you want to show on the screen by modifying the parameters from the data we get from the API response which is in the form of a JSON.
